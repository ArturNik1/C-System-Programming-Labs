# Labs
This repository includes all the Systems Programming Labs assignments in Ben Gurion University, Israel. The course is part of computer science bachelor's degree mandatory courses.

Most of the labs are written in C, while some of them in x86 Assembly in Linux Ubunutu. Each lab composes of sub-tasks.

I used makefiles to compile the code and used Kate as a development enviroment.
